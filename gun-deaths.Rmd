# Gun deaths by age

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

The peak of the distribution is around 22 years of age, with a second smaller peak around 50 years of age.

# Gun deaths by race

```{r race-dist}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Victim race")
```
